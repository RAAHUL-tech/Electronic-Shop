# Electronic-Shop
A common platform to buy and sell both new and used products in one place.

This website is built using two technologies. One module is developed using Java and the other module uses PHP. The code inside the SHOP folder contains the PHP module. The code inside src/main contains the Java module. The pom.xml file contains all the dependencies for the Java module. To run this project create a new PHP project and a new Java Maven project separately. Copy and paste the appropriate files on each of these project folders. Create the necessary database tables mentioned in the project.


The video of how the website works is presented below:
